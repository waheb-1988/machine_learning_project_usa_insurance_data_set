# Machine Learning Project: USA Insurance Data Set  

## Overview  
This project involves analyzing and building machine learning models using the USA Insurance Data Set. The primary objective is to explore the dataset, uncover valuable insights, and build predictive models to estimate insurance costs based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  

## Project Objectives  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's features and distributions.  
- Build predictive models to estimate insurance costs using machine learning algorithms.  
- Evaluate and compare model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²).  
- Derive actionable insights to help insurance companies make data-driven decisions.  

## Dataset Description  
The dataset used in this project contains information about insurance policyholders in the USA, including:  
- **Age**: Age of the policyholder.  
- **Sex**: Gender of the policyholder (male/female).  
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight.  
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents covered under the insurance policy.  
- **Smoker**: Smoking status of the policyholder (yes/no).  
- **Region**: Geographic region where the policyholder resides.  
- **Charges**: Medical costs billed to the policyholder.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and machine learning.  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.  
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models and evaluation metrics.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive data analysis and model development environment.  

## Machine Learning Models Implemented  
- **Linear Regression**: To model the relationship between features and insurance charges.  
- **Random Forest Regressor**: An ensemble learning method to improve prediction accuracy.  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: To capture complex patterns in the data.  

## Results and Insights  
- **Linear Regression** provided a baseline performance with an R² score of X.  
- **Random Forest Regressor** outperformed other models with an R² score of Y, indicating better predictive power.  
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor** showed competitive performance with high accuracy and generalization.  
- Key features influencing insurance charges included **BMI**, **age**, and **smoking status**.
